# Bellybutton
In this project we completed panel for demographic information. Specifically, here we are able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, we will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.
